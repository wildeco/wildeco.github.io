## Introduction

Human-wildlife conflict has become an increasingly pressing issue in today's world as the human population continues to expand and encroach on natural habitats. The conflicts that arise from this interaction between humans and wildlife can have detrimental effects on both parties involved. Leopard-human conflict is a specific type of human-wildlife conflict that has become a significant issue in many parts of the world. Leopards are highly adaptable animals that can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas. As such, they often come into contact with humans, which can lead to conflict. 

It is crucial to understand the nature of these conflicts, their causes, and their impact on both humans and wildlife in different contexts and over time.Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of leopord-human conflict helps to: 

* Determine which areas are most at risk and help develop effective mitigation strategies. 
* Gain insight into the underlying causes of these conflicts (e.g., habitat loss, land use change, agricultural practices, prey abundance). 

## Method

In this blog post we use a space-time tool available in ArcGIS to model spatio-temporal patterns of leopard-human conflict in Kathmandu valley, Nepal. The sample contains 345 records of conflicts recorded by household survey conducted in 2019. We also  explore how the conflict trend and human population trend overlap. 

More on the methods: 

* Create space-time cube [See how it works](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/space-time-pattern-mining/learnmorecreatecube.htm)
* Mann-Kendall Trend test
* Sen's slope 


## Results

The results show that the south-western region of the valley has detected high risk of conflict. Further, there are random conflicts in north region, with no detectable patterns. There appears to be some positive correlation between conflict hotspots and increasing population density (we need to conduct a statistical test to confirm this). 

Further analysis will be conducted in the future.
