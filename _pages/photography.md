I enjoy occasional photography, mostly on nature and streets. I have been using my iphone 11 pro max for most of my photography. I had a Canon 7D DSLR camera for a while, but no longer - but I think I should get a good cam soon. I have uploaded some of my photos on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@roshan-sharma-517632505/), a free stock photo website. I will need to find the old photos from my DSLR and upload them here, hopefully soon. 

Here are some of them: 

**Every log has a story, Lysterfield Park, Vic, Australia** Nov 2022, shot with iphone 11 pro max
