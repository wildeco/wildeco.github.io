Conservation impact evaluation is a process of assessing the effectiveness of conservation programs or interventions in achieving their intended objectives. It involves measuring the difference between what has been achieved with the program and what would have occurred in the absence of the program - 'the counterfactual', using methods such as quasi-experimental designs, or other empirical methods. The aim of conservation impact evaluation is to provide evidence-based information to improve the design and implementation of conservation programs and policies, and to ensure that limited resources are directed towards programs that have the greatest positive impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

***Evaluating impact of conservation programs***

Typically, conservation programs are evaluated by estimating the average impact at the program level, which allows for comparisons between programs or regions but masks the variation in impact across individual program units. In this research, we develop a reliable and clear methodology that includes synthetic control design, statistical matching, and time series data to estimate the impact of individual protected areas over time. We also demonstrate how the impact at the individual level can be combined to estimate program-level impact using a meta-analytic approach. The framework was utilised to evaluate the impact of conservation agreements in Victoria, Australia. The research paper is currently in a peer review. 

In a separate study we evaluate the impact of biodiversity offsetting on native vegetation in Victoria, Australia. The research paper is available as a preprint on [OSP Preprints](https://osf.io/v36sg/download) and is ongoing a peer-review in Global Change Biology. 

***Predicting future impact of conservation programs***

The evaluations of impact in conservation are typically done after the programs have been implemented, which limits their usefulness in predicting future performance due to changes in ecosystems and policies. Additionally, the long time lags between implementation and response make it difficult to capture the true impact of newly implemented programs using conventional evaluation methods. To address this issue, predictive models should be used to evaluate future impact. Despite the extensive work that has been done on ex-post evaluations, there has been little emphasis on utilizing forecasting and predictive methods to estimate impact in conservation. In this research project, we develop predictive framework to estimate the impact of conservation interventions on biodiversity. 

## Theme 2: Spatial conservation prioritization for impact

Systematic conservation planning is a well-established discipline which has been used to inform reserve design in many parts of the world. Most of these approaches, however, have focused on the representation of ecosystem units at various scales and the loss of ecosystems if they are not reserved. The importance of achieving impact in conservation is growing in recent decades – where the outcomes of already implemented programs is compared to a counterfactual scenario where the program is not implemented. However, much of the research has focused on evaluating past conservation programs – and not much to conduct an ex-ante evaluation which are evaluations done before the program is implemented. In the context of achieving impact - rather than preserving ‘residual areas’ which would be intact regardless of protection, it is increasingly important to focus on the protection and conservation of areas which help deliver higher impact alongside maintaining and enhancing the integrity and viability of ecosystems and species. These kinds of ex-ante evaluations would be extremely useful in conservation planning such that reserves are established on areas to maximizing impact. We are developing a framework to conducting ex-ante conservation impact to develop a conservation plan for private land conservation in Victoria. The planning is done in two steps; first is the identification of high value biodiversity private land and second, within these private lands to identify and prioritize land parcels that will deliver conservation impact over the years. 

## Theme 3: Predictive modelling to detect risk of woody vegetation clearing

Predictive modeling can be used to detect the risk of vegetation clearing by analyzing various factors that contribute to vegetation clearing. These factors can include land use changes, economic development, population growth, and other drivers of deforestation and land degradation. To create a predictive model, relevant data on these factors can be gathered from sources such as satellite imagery, land use maps, demographic data, and socioeconomic indicators. The data can then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between different variables. By analyzing these patterns, the predictive model can identify areas that are at risk of vegetation clearing, and can help to inform conservation and land-use planning efforts. For example, the model can be used to identify areas where conservation efforts are most needed, or where land-use policies and regulations may need to be strengthened to prevent further vegetation clearing. In addition to identifying areas at risk of vegetation clearing, predictive modeling can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different conservation and land-use strategies. By comparing the predicted outcomes of different strategies, conservation practitioners and policymakers can determine which strategies are most likely to achieve their desired outcomes, and can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources to achieve conservation goals.
