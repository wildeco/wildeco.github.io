# My research areas
I work is varied. 

## Some of my work: 



## Spatial Conservation Prioritization

Spatial conservation prioritization is a field of study and practice that focuses on identifying the most important areas for conservation in a given region or ecosystem. The goal of spatial conservation prioritization is to maximize conservation outcomes by targeting areas that are most critical for protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also taking into account factors such as ecological connectivity, land use, and human activities.

Spatial conservation prioritization uses a range of methods and tools, including geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and ecological modeling, to analyze spatial data and identify priority areas for conservation. These methods can help to identify areas that are important for biodiversity, provide critical habitat for endangered species, or are essential for maintaining ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and water filtration.

By using spatial conservation prioritization, conservation practitioners can focus their efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact for protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services. This approach can help to ensure that limited conservation resources are used efficiently and effectively, and can lead to more successful conservation outcomes in the long run.


## Impact evaluation using BSTS

Impact evaluation of protected areas is a process of assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in achieving their conservation objectives. Protected areas, such as national parks, wildlife reserves, and other types of conservation areas, are established to conserve biodiversity, protect natural resources, and provide ecosystem services. Impact evaluation aims to determine whether these areas are meeting their intended goals and to identify areas for improvement.

The impact evaluation of protected areas typically involves the collection and analysis of data on various aspects of the protected area and its surrounding ecosystem. This can include information on biodiversity, ecosystem services, human activities, and socio-economic factors. The evaluation may also involve comparing the protected area to nearby areas that are not protected or have different management strategies.

Impact evaluation can help conservation practitioners and policymakers to determine whether protected areas are achieving their intended outcomes, and if not, to identify areas for improvement. The evaluation can also provide insights into the factors that contribute to the success or failure of protected areas, and can help to inform future conservation planning and management decisions.

Overall, impact evaluation of protected areas is a critical component of conservation management, as it provides evidence-based insights into the effectiveness of protected area strategies, and helps to ensure that conservation efforts are targeted and efficient.

## Predictive modelling to detect risk of vegetation clearing

Predictive modeling can be used to detect the risk of vegetation clearing by analyzing various factors that contribute to vegetation clearing. These factors can include land use changes, economic development, population growth, and other drivers of deforestation and land degradation.

To create a predictive model, relevant data on these factors can be gathered from sources such as satellite imagery, land use maps, demographic data, and socioeconomic indicators. The data can then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between different variables.

By analyzing these patterns, the predictive model can identify areas that are at risk of vegetation clearing, and can help to inform conservation and land-use planning efforts. For example, the model can be used to identify areas where conservation efforts are most needed, or where land-use policies and regulations may need to be strengthened to prevent further vegetation clearing.

In addition to identifying areas at risk of vegetation clearing, predictive modeling can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different conservation and land-use strategies. By comparing the predicted outcomes of different strategies, conservation practitioners and policymakers can determine which strategies are most likely to achieve their desired outcomes, and can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources to achieve conservation goals.
